Repres

Which sort of word types are variables and which words are equivalent?

Ops

Special cases of words which correspond to logical operators, for example "or" and "and" (may not exist in such a pure form in all natural languages).

Types

This regex entries define which words are from which type.

Rules

They are only important if you really know what you are doing,
by default the system generates them when it hears synonymous sentences,
it tries to reduce new grammatical structures to a combination of known ones,
Rules describes the mapping between grammatical structures and logical meaning (with an optional command argument).

Axioms

Here you can define additional FOL axioms to the included ones in MOM0.1.py's BaseAxioms.

CustomCode

Here you can define Python functions called by the optional command argument of the Rules with access to the Request function which makes it easy to collect the needed knowledge before starting a procedural custom algorithm.

Sentences

The place for knowledge in language form.

Note

Most of the definition file is also trainable by simply chatting to the AI,
but sometimes a adjustment of the deffile is needed. (For example if you want to define custom algorithms)
